This is my first major Terraria mod. It is a love letter to one of my favorite games, Deep Rock Galactic. Honestly, this may be a violation of Ghost Ship Game's IP, but I don't care because I love that game.

The mod implements 4 new weapons, a whole lot of upgrades for those weapons, and 1 new NPC. I'm trying to keep it as vanilla-friendly as possible, but the balancing of this mod gets a little bit hectic.

Mod by scottsimply.
